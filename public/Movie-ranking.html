<hr />
        <h3>Full Metal Jacket</h3>
        <p>Full Metal Jacket exemplifies the difficulties of enlisting in the military and being deployed to war.</p>
        <h3>Avengers End Game</h3>
        <p>This movie was beutifully made and has an entertaining story line.</p>
        <h3>The Exorcist</h3>
        <p>This is the classic horror movie. The only one that still scares me to this date. </p>
